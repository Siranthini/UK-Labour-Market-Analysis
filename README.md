The analysis focuses on skill gaps, salary trends, and employment rates, providing valuable insights for policymakers, educators, and employers.

## Scripts

The repository is organized into four main scripts, each serving a distinct purpose in the analysis:

### Skill Gap Prediction (`Skillgap_model.py`)

This script is dedicated to predicting skill gaps within the UK labour market. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to model the presence and extent of skill gaps based on various predictors such as industry sector, employee training days, and more.

### Salary Prediction (`Salary_Prediction_Model.py`)

The `Salary_Prediction_Model.py` file contains code for forecasting salary trends over time. By analyzing historical salary data, the script provides projections that can help understand future salary patterns in the market.

### Employment Rate Prediction (`ER_model.py`)

This script models the employment rate trends within the UK labour market. It is designed to predict employment rates based on demographic and economic factors, aiding in the assessment of employment prospects.

### Visuals (`Visualisations.py`)

The `Visualisations.py` script is responsible for creating visual representations of the data and analysis results. It generates charts and graphs that illustrate the findings in an accessible and informative manner.

## Setup

To run these scripts, you will need Python installed on your machine along with the necessary libraries. Clone the repository and install the dependencies
